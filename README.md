This repository contains examples and sample projects demonstrating **Advanced Java and J2EE (Java EE)** concepts such as **JDBC**, **Servlets**, and **JSP** for building web applications using core Java technologies.

> The projects include hands-on examples to help you learn server-side Java web development (JDBC database connectivity, HTTP Servlets, JSP pages). 


## 📌 Overview

This repository demonstrates various advanced Java web development topics including:

- **JDBC** – connecting to databases from Java applications.  
- **Servlets** – building server-side Java classes that handle HTTP requests.  
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)** – building dynamic web pages with embedded Java. 

These examples are useful for learners, students, and developers who want real code samples on enterprise Java fundamentals.

## 🛠️ Technologies

This repository uses:

- Java (core language)  
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)  
- Servlets (HTTP request/response handling)  
- JSP (dynamic Java web pages)  
- Usually run on a Servlet container like Apache Tomcat

## 📥 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Java JDK** (8 or higher)  
2. **Apache Tomcat** (or any servlet container)  
3. **Database server** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) for JDBC examples  
4. IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans)  
5. (Optional) **Maven/Gradle** if using build tools

## 🧪 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikhilsinghp/AdvancedJavaJ2EE.git
Import into your IDE as a Java Web or Dynamic Web Project.

Configure Tomcat as the runtime server in IDE.

Set up database connection (JDBC examples):

Add JDBC driver (e.g., MySQL Connector/J) to project lib.

Update DB credentials in Java config files.

Deploy & Run the application on Tomcat.

Access the web pages via:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:8080/<project-name>/
📘 Examples Included
JDBC
Examples for connecting to a database, executing SQL queries, and processing results.

Servlet
Basic examples showing how to handle HTTP GET and POST requests in servlets.

JSP
Web pages with embedded Java logic for displaying dynamic content.

These examples together teach you how to build web applications using standard J2EE building blocks.
